# Sprite Animations

This project is a demonstration of sprite animations using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. It showcases various animation states of a sprite character, allowing users to interactively switch between different animations like idle, jump, fall, run, and more.


## Features

- **Multiple Animation States:** Includes a range of animation states like idle, jump, fall, run, dizzy, sit, roll, bite, KO, and get hit.
- **Interactive Controls:** Users can change the animation state of the sprite character using a dropdown menu.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** Animations are rendered in real-time on the HTML5 Canvas, providing a smooth visual experience.
